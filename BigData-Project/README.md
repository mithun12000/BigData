#Analysis of Medicare billings and Pharmaceutical payments using Big Data Approach

Description: The main aim of this project is to find correlation between the average Medicare billings for the “Cardiovascular stress test” procedure by address and the total cost of pharmaceutical payments made to each address.
This because there are factors that might affect the different cost of "Cardio Vascular Stress Test" throughout the US. Also there is a hypothesis that pharmaceutical companies pay the physicians to use their products with some procedures
that have the highest profit margin. Hence it is required to find the correlation between average medicare billings and total payments made to a physicians office.

The above obtained correlation value for both the procedure is close to 0 and hence there is barely any correlation between the Medicare payments and pharmaceutical payments.
